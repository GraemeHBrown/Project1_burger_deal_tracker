# Codeclan Project 1:  Burger deals tracker Ruby CRUD web application

For our first project at Codeclan we were tasked with creating a full stack Ruby MVC web application using the Sinatra framework and connnected with a Postgres RDBMS.

The specification put in place certain restrictions for the project including prohibiting any ORM or use of other framework.  We were tasked with creating the data model and linking up the Postgres schema with Ruby by creating models, controllers and views using embedded Ruby (erb).

All seven of the RESTful routes had to be demonstrated for each entity that was needed in our model.
